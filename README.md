## Code description

This script is a fantastic starting point for your virtual health assistant! It combines the functionality of a chatbot with a GUI for user interaction, making it user-friendly and practical. Here's a quick breakdown of what this code achieves:

1. User Interaction:
The user types their query into an input field.
The chatbot displays both the user's query and its own responses in a scrollable chat window.
2. Responses:
The chatbot provides health tips based on simple keyword matching. For example, entering "headache" triggers advice on managing tension headaches.
3. GUI Features:
It uses Tkinter for creating the graphical interface, with components like a scrollable text box (ScrolledText) and input fields.
4. Suggestions for Enhancement
* If you want to refine it further:
Expand Response Database: Use a more sophisticated NLP model (e.g., spaCy or a transformer-based model) to understand user queries better.

Add More Features: Include a symptom checker that suggests multiple potential causes.

Improve UI/UX: Add icons, themes, or animations to make the interface more visually appealing.

Mobile Compatibility: Consider converting it into a mobile app using frameworks like Kivy or Flask (for web-based deployment).
